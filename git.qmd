# Git and GitHub {#sec-day1-git}

## Prerequites

1.  Create a GitHub account: [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
2.  Install Git: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setting Up Git and GitHub

There are two main approaches for setting up a new R project that you want on GitHub:

-   Approach 1: Create project using Git, then download it to your machine
-   Approach 2: Begin with pre-existing `RStudio` project, and then connect to GitHub

The first approach tends to be easier.

### Why care about Git?

1.  You will submit assignments to GitHub for peer-marking.
2.  Industry uses Git for everything.

At minimum, Git provides you with a highly improved method of saving your work.
With Git, you will never name a file `final_version_72` again!
At its core, Git is a version control of documents which allows you to keep track of changes made and revert to previous changes if need be.
Furthermore, it allows for collaboration without having to send updated versions to your friend in zip files over and over.
There is an abundance of Git-jargon; you only need these few words to start:

-   Repository (pronounced *Repo*) : *The folder where we store everything we want to track.*

-   Clone: *Copy another repo so you can plagiarize as your own*

-   Fork: *Collaborate on someone else's repo*

-   Commit: *Create a checkpoint in the repo, locally*

-   Pull: *Update the repo with any changes not already on your version*

-   Push: *Make your checkpoint (commit) visible globally*

### Approach 1: Create project using Git, then download it to your machine

Within here, there are two approaches.
One of them uses GitHub Desktop, a standalone program, and the other uses [github.com](https://github.com) itself, the website.

We **strongly** suggest using GitHub Desktop, as it will make managing your Git repositories easier after setup.

#### Use GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a standalone program for working with Git and GitHub.
It is very beginner-friendly.
See [this](https://amathuba.uct.ac.za/d2l/le/lessons/166536/topics/3707345) for more.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%20=8Dd7KRpKeaE) describing how to use it.
It breaks down the basics, but contains a little more information than you need, so you can stop when you are set up.

#### Use GitHub

You can also create a new repo directly on GitHub, and then clone it (Git-speak for download it).
Here are the instructions: [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first).

### Approach 2: Begin with `RStudio` project on your machine, and then connect it to GitHub

See the video `git.mp4` for this process illustrated.

In `RStudio`, open your project.

Then, run the following code.

#### Install `usethis`

Firstly, ensure `usethis` is installed:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("usethis", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("usethis")
}
```

#### Introduce yourself to Git

Then, if you have not set Git up before, you'll need to run the following.
Note that by "not set up Git", I do not mean whether you've installed Git, but rather whether you've given Git basic authorship information.
If you're not sure, you can run the following:

``` r
gert::git_config_global()
```

I am not exactly sure what it looks like if you've not set up Git authorship information, but the key thing is that it will not have a row where the first column is `user.name` and the second column is your name, and a row where the first column is `user.email` and the second column is your email address.

If you can see you've not set `user.name` and `user.email`, then run the following, swopping `NULL` with your name and email address:

``` r
# set your username and your email address
username <- NULL  # replace NULL with e.g. "Miguel Rodo" (be sure to include the quotes)
email <- NULL # replace NULL with e.g. "miguel.rodo@uct.ac.za"
stopifnot(!is.null(username)) # just checking you set this
stopifnot(!is.null(email))
gert::git_config_global_set("user.name",  username)
gert::git_config_global_set("user.email", email)
```

#### Initialise Git for the project

Finally, you are ready to initialise `git` for that project:

``` r
usethis::use_git()
```

When it asks you whether you want to commit the extra files, say yes.
Be aware that you don't type "Absolutely" or "Definitely" or whatever corresponds to "yes", you just type the number that corresponds to `yes`.

After running the above, to get the `Git` pane to appear in the top right corner (alongside `Environment` and `History`), you need to close and re-open `RStudio`.

You will not need to install `usethis` and set `Git` authorship information for each project, but you will need to initialise `Git` for each project.

#### Connect Git to GitHub

Run the following code:

``` r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Name the token, set the expiry date and click on `Create`.
Then copy the token (it looks like `ghp_akerjlwk4j5qlk45j`).

Then, run the following code:

``` r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

and paste your token.
