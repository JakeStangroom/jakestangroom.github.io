Below are some examples to illustrate the required *R* syntax.\n\n## For Loops\n\nThe general structure of the syntax is:\n\n`for (indicator in iterable){ ... }`\n\nwhere the indicator is a variable which iterates through an object which is *iterable*. Therefore, indicator can be anything.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 1:10\n\nsum = 0 \nfor (i in a){\n  sum = sum + i\n}\nprint(sum)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 55\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsentence <- \"hello world and some other words\"\nanIterable <- strsplit(sentence, \" \")\nfor (word in anIterable){\n  print(word)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"hello\" \"world\" \"and\"   \"some\"  \"other\" \"words\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can even have nested for loops, which is when we have a for loop within another for loop!\n\n## While Loops\n\nThe general structure of the syntax is:\n\n`While (condition) { ... }`\n\nwhere the condition is a Boolean (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). It could be the result of many conditions combined with logical operators. This loop will continue until this condition is false.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax = 10\nx <- 0; i <- 0\nwhile(x <= max){\n  i <- i + 1\n  x <- x + 2 * i \n}\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
