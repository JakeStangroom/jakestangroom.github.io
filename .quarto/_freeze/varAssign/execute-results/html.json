That is, you can assign a value to a variable by using either of the operators `<-` or `=`, whereby the `<-` operator is preferred. This is not quite complete.\n\n1.  There are more assignment operators\n\n2.  They are not all *truly* equivalent\n\n*Tip: you can press `Alt`* + `-` *to get `<-`* *when in a code chunk or r-script.*\n\n## Assignment Operators\n\nWhilst the operators: `<-`, `=` are definitely the most common assignment operators in *R*, `<<-` , `->`, and `->>` are also valid assignment operators. Therefore, the following will all achieve the same result, the number 3 will be stored to the appropriate variable:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 3\nb = 3\nd <<- 3\n3 -> e\n3 ->> f\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(d)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(e)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhere the problem arises is with functions and a notion called *scope*.\n\n### What is scope?\n\nWithout getting too technical, when we assign a variable to a value there is a block of memory which gets allocated to store the information of that variable. For example, when we assign `a <- 3`, there is a small bit (48 bytes) of memory which is allocated to the variable `a`. That means that when `a` is referenced, *R* knows to go look at that memory which shows that the value of the variable is `3`. This memory allocation is not necessarily persistent.\n\nWhen we assign a variable in general, then the memory allocation will remain there until we explicitly remove it; however, when we call a function, that is **not** necessarily true. For example, consider the following code chunk:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf <- function(input){\n  localVar <- input\n  return(localVar)\n}\n\nprint(localVar)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe function assigns the `input` to a variable, `localVar` but the `print(localVar)` line will produce an error. This is because the memory allocation for `localVar` is only assigned for the use of the function. Once the function returns, then that memory allocation is freed up once more. Therefore, we call the variable a *local variable* since it can realistically only be used within the function. A variable which is stored indefinitely is known as a *global variable.* The period for which the variable is allocated can be loosely termed as its scope.\n\n### Where is the problem?\n\nNow let us break the function. Firstly, let us clear all variables which have been assigned previously, and then reassign the same function above.\n\n1.  Option One:\n\n    Firstly, we can choose to call the function with the `=` operator. Then `f(input = 3)` will return `3` as expected. However, the line `print(input)` will cause an error. This is because `=` only allocated as a local variable.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n\nf <- function(input){\n  localVar <- input\n  return(localVar)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(f(input = 3))\nprint(input)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2.  Option Two:\n\n    Alternatively, we could call the function as follows. This will return the same value for the function call **AND** allow the print command. This is because `input` is assigned as a global variable in the function call.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(f(input <- 3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(input)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Option one is best practice for coding**. Using option 2 can make code fairly difficult to keep track of. Consider the following example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- function(a){\n  a <- a * 3\n  return(a)\n}\n\ng(a <- 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe function will return a value of `6` as expected, but the global variable will still be stored as `2`. This is because any changes made to the variable in the function are actually made to a local variable copy of `a` and not on `a` itself.\n\n### What about the `<<-` operator?\n\nClearly, when using functions, one needs to be careful of global and local variables. Essentially, when a function is called, any variable is either a global variable (defined outside the function and visible to everything) or a locally defined variable (in the sense that we define a new variable inside the function).\n\nUnintended issues can arise however, when trying to make changes to one of these global variables; only a copy of the actual global variable is used inside of a function scope. The operator `<<-` can get around this.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- function(){\n  globalVariable <- 1\n  return(globalVariable)\n}\n(g())\nprint(globalVariable)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis code fails because `globalVariable` is only a local variable definition inside the function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- function(){\n  globalVariable <<- 1\n  return(globalVariable)\n}\n(g())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(globalVariable)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `<<-` operator is a global assignment operator, bypassing the locality of function, as seen in the following extract.\n\nNote: it can be beneficial to provide a small description of the functions you write as follows.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naVariable <- 100\n\nh <- function(b){\n  # A function to help show local variables are separate from global variables\n  # \n  # Args:\n  #   b (double) - multiplies 'aVariable'\n  # \n  # Return:\n  #   (double) - updated 'aVariable'??\n  \n  aVariable <- aVariable * b\n  \n  return(aVariable)\n}\n\n\n(h(b = 3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 300\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(aVariable)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 100\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nh <- function(b){\n  aVariable <<- aVariable * b\n  \n  return(aVariable)\n}\n\n\n(h(b = 3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 300\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(aVariable)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 300\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## TL;DR\n\n1.  Use `<-` for normal variable assignment\n2.  Use `=` when making a function call, for example: `f(a = 3)`.\n3.  Avoid `<<-` unless you are very sure!\n",
