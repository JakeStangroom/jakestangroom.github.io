The text itself is written in **Markdown**, a lightweight formatting language that allows us to structure documents with headings, bullet points, bold and italic text, and more.  \n\nTwo key tools for literate programming in R are `R Markdown` and `Quarto`.  \n\n---\n\n## R Markdown  \n\n### What is R Markdown?\n\n`R Markdown` was the original tool for embedding code within documents. It allows users to write reports, create presentations, and generate formatted documents that include both text and code outputs.  \n\n### Structure of an R Markdown File \n\nAn **R Markdown file (`.Rmd`)** consists of three main components:  \n\n#### YAML Front Matter  \nThe **YAML front matter** is the metadata at the top of the document. It controls the output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word).  \n\nExample:  \n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Report\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n```\nThis tells R Markdown to generate an **HTML** document. Other options include `pdf_document` and `word_document`.  \n\n#### Code Chunks\n\nCode chunks are sections of executable code, enclosed by triple backticks (```) with a specified language. In our case, it will be **R**:  \n\n> ::: {.cell}\n> \n> ```{.r .cell-code}\n> summary(cars)\n> ```\n> :::\n\n- Backticks (`) are usually found next to the number 1 key on the keyboard.\n- By default, all code in chunks is executed when the document is rendered.  \n\n**Chunk Options:**  \n- **`echo = FALSE`** → Hides the code but still runs it.  \n- **`echo = TRUE`** → Displays both the code and its output.  \n- **Other options** can control figure size, message display, and more.  \n\nExample:\n\n> ::: {.cell}\n> ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n> \n> ```\n>      speed           dist       \n>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n> ```\n> \n> \n> :::\n> :::\n\nThe summary will appear in the final document, but the code itself won’t be displayed.  \n\n#### Markdown Formatting  \n\nMarkdown is used for structuring text.  \n\n- **Headings:** Use `#` for headings (`##` for subheadings, `###` for deeper levels).  \n- **Bullet points:** Use `-` or `*`.  \n- **Numbered lists:** Use `1.`, `2.`, etc.  \n- **Bold text:** `**bold**` → **bold**  \n- **Italic text:** `*italic*` → *italic*  \n\n### Output  \nR Markdown can **embed plots, tables, and formatted text** into a document. When you include code that generates a plot, the plot will be displayed in the final output.  \n\n---\n\n## Quarto  \n\n### What is Quarto? \n\nQuarto is the **successor to R Markdown**. It is very similar but:  \n- Has a different YAML front matter structure.  \n- Supports more programming languages (via Jupyter).  \n- Provides a **more unified** workflow for reports, websites, and books.  \n\n### Differences in YAML\n\nInstead of specifying `output: html_document` like in R Markdown, Quarto uses:  \n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Report\"\nformat: html\n---\n```\n\nQuarto uses `format` instead of `output`, making it more flexible.  \n\n### Code Chunks in Quarto  \nQuarto code chunks function similarly to R Markdown, but chunk options can be specified in a cleaner way:\n  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| eval: false\nsummary(cars)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing `#| option: value` inside the chunk makes options easier to read and manage.  \n\n---\n\n## Quarto Projects  \n\n### Why Use Quarto Projects? \n\nOne limitation of R Markdown was that while you could generate individual reports (`.html`, `.pdf`, etc.), managing multiple files in a project (e.g., a website) required extra tools like `bookdown`.  \n\n**Quarto solves this by providing built-in support for project structures.**  \n\n### Starting a Quarto Project\n\n#### Via `RStudio` GUI\n\nUnfortunately, in `RStudio` one cannot start a Quart project via the `New File` menu.\nInstead, you have to start a new `RStudio` project entirely.\nThe change is that you must select `Quarto Project` from the `New Project` menu.\n\n#### By adding a `quarto.yml` file\n\nAlternatively, what you can do is simply add a `_quarto.yml` file.\nHere is an example `_quarto.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nproject:\n  type: book\n  render:\n  - index.qmd\n  output-dir: docs\nbook:\n  title: Statistical Computing\n  sidebar:\n    border: true\n    background: light\n    position: right\n  navbar:\n    search: true\n    background: light\n  chapters:\n  - index.qmd\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    toc-location: left\n```\n\nA brief explanation of this file:\n\n- `index.qmd` is the \"base\" `qmd`. It is the first file that will be rendered. Always include it.\n  - If you want to include other files, then specify them in the `chapters` and `render` keys.\n- `output-dir` specifies where the output will be saved. In this case, it will be saved in a `docs` folder.\n- `book` specifies the title of the book, the sidebar, the navbar, and the chapters.\n- `format` specifies specific formatting options for the `html` outputL\n  - The `theme` defines the overall appearance of the website.\n  - `toc` specifies whether a table of contents should be generated, and the `toc-depth` specifies how many levels of headings should be included.\n\n### Defining a Quarto Project \n\nA **Quarto project** is defined by a `quarto.yml` file, which specifies how multiple `.qmd` files should be compiled together.  \n\nExample of a `quarto.yml` file for a website:  \n```yaml\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n```\n\nThis tells Quarto:  \n- The project is a **website**.  .  \n- A **table of contents** should be generated (`toc: true`) for headings up to level 3 (`toc-depth: 3`).\n\n### Website vs. Book\n\n- **Website (`type: website`)**  \n  - Only outputs HTML.  \n  - Has a navigation bar linking different pages.  \n- **Book (`type: book`)**  \n  - Can output HTML, PDF, or Word.  \n  - Uses a `chapters:` key to define sections.  \n\nExample `quarto.yml` for a book:  \n```yaml\nproject:\n  type: book\n\nbook:\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - analysis.qmd\n\nformat:\n  pdf: \n    documentclass: book\n```\n\nHere:  \n- The **chapters** define the book structure.  \n- The **format** section customizes the outputs.\n\n### Rendering a Quarto Project\n\nTo build the entire project, use the **`quarto` R package**:  \n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"quarto\")\nquarto::quarto_render()\n```\n\n- This **renders all files** in the project according to `quarto.yml`.  \n- For **websites**, output is saved in `_site/`.  \n- For **books**, output is saved in `_book/`.  \n\n### Important Notes\n \n- To start a new Quarto project, go to **RStudio → New Project → Quarto Project**.  \n- If creating a website, ensure you have an `index.qmd` file—websites require an `index.html` as the main entry point.\n- Clicking the `Knit` button in RStudio will render the current `.qmd` file, but **`quarto::quarto_render()` is needed for the entire project**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- `R Markdown` is an older tool for combining code and text, using `.Rmd` files.  \n- `Quarto` is the modern alternative, offering more flexibility and better multi-file management.  \n- **Quarto Projects** allow multiple `.qmd` files to be rendered together, creating websites or books.  \n\nBy using Quarto, we can **write reports, build websites, and generate books—all from the same toolset!**",
