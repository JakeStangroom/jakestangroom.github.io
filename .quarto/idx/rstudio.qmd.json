{"title":"Setting Up Your Computer","markdown":{"headingText":"Setting Up Your Computer","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nBefore diving into R, make sure your system is set up properly:\n\n1.  **Install the Latest Version of R**\\\n    Download the most current release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).\\\n    ***IMPORTANT:*** Ensure you update to the latest version before starting this course—even if R is already installed—as older versions may cause unexpected issues when using newer `R` packages (like this [^rstudio-1])\n\n2.  **Install RStudio (Recommended IDE for R)**\\\n    Get RStudio from [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).\n\n3.  **Launch RStudio**\\\n    Open RStudio, and you're all set to begin!\n\n[^rstudio-1]: The packages we ask you to install are usually *easy* to install, so if you have errors like this, it might be because your `R` is out of date:\n\n## Configure RStudio Settings\n\nRefer to the video `rstudio_settings.mp4` for a visual guide. Follow these steps to configure your RStudio settings:\n\n### 1. General Settings\n\nNavigate to **Tools → Global Options → General**.\n\n-   **Workspace subsection:**\n    -   **Uncheck** `Restore .RData into workspace at startup`\\\n        Prevents old objects from automatically loading when opening RStudio, ensuring a clean and reproducible environment.\n    -   **Set** `Save workspace to .RData on exit` to **Never**\\\n        This avoids saving hidden dependencies that can make your scripts less reproducible.\n\n### 2. Code Editing Settings\n\nGo to **Tools → Global Options → Code → Editing**.\n\n-   **Enable \"Use Native Pipe Operator (`|>`)\":**\\\n    Since you’ll be using a later version of R, this setting improves readability and reduces dependency on packages like `{magrittr}`.\n-   **Enable \"Soft-wrap R source files\":**\\\n    This ensures that long lines wrap within the editor, so you don’t have to scroll horizontally even if the code line is long.\n\n### 3. Code Display Settings\n\nUnder **Tools → Global Options → Code → Display**:\n\n-   **Enable \"Rainbow Parentheses\":**\\\n    Displays matching parentheses in different colors, making nested expressions easier to read and reducing errors.\n\n### 4. Appearance Settings\n\nFinally, go to **Tools → Global Options → Appearance**.\n\n-   **Editor Font:** Change to a monospaced font (for example, JetBrains Mono). A monospaced font ensures each character takes up the same width, improving alignment and readability.\n-   **Editor Theme:** Choose a dark theme instead of the default light theme to reduce eye strain. Good options include:\n    -   Cobalt (recommended)\n    -   Monokai\n    -   Solarized Dark\n    -   Twilight\n\nThese settings help improve usability, maintainability, and comfort while coding in RStudio.\n\n# Overview of the RStudio Interface\n\nRefer to the video `rstudio_interface.mp4` for a detailed overview. RStudio is divided into four main panes:\n\n## 1. Script Editor (Top Left)\n\nThis is where you write and edit your scripts (files ending in `.R`, `.Rmd`, or `.qmd`). A script is essentially a record of instructions that R executes. Use `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) to run code from the script; the command output will appear in the Console.\n\n## 2. Console and Terminal (Bottom Left)\n\n-   **Console:**\\\n    Where R executes commands. You can run code from your script or type directly into the Console to test ideas.\n-   **Terminal:**\\\n    Adjacent to the Console, this pane runs system shell commands. It shares the same working directory as R but interprets commands using your system shell (PowerShell on Windows, Bash on Linux, or Zsh/Bash on Mac).\n\n## 3. Environment and History (Top Right)\n\n-   **Environment Tab:**\\\n    Lists all objects (variables, data, functions) currently loaded in your R session.\n-   **History Tab:**\\\n    Displays a record of all commands you have executed.\n\n## 4. Files, Plots, Packages, and Help (Bottom Right)\n\n-   **Files Tab:**\\\n    Shows files and folders in your current working directory.\n-   **Plots Tab:**\\\n    Displays any generated plots; you can zoom in, export (to PNG, PDF, JPEG, etc.), and clear old plots.\n-   **Packages Tab:**\\\n    Lists installed R packages and offers management options.\n-   **Help Tab:**\\\n    Provides documentation for functions and packages. You can search for help topics here or use the `?function_name` command in the Console.\n\nThis interface layout makes it easy to write, test, and manage your R code.\n\n-   installing *source*
