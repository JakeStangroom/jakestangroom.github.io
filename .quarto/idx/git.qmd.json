Create a GitHub account: [GitHub](https://www.github.com).\n2.  Install Git: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n\n## Setting Up Git and GitHub\n\nThere are two main approaches for setting up a new R project that you want on GitHub:\n\n-   Approach 1: Create project using Git, then download it to your machine\n-   Approach 2: Begin with pre-existing `RStudio` project, and then connect to GitHub\n\nThe first approach tends to be easier.\n\n### Why care about Git?\n\n1.  You will submit assignments to GitHub for peer-marking.\n2.  Industry uses Git for everything.\n\nAt minimum, Git provides you with a highly improved method of saving your work.\nWith Git, you will never name a file `final_version_72` again!\nAt its core, Git is a version control of documents which allows you to keep track of changes made and revert to previous changes if need be.\nFurthermore, it allows for collaboration without having to send updated versions to your friend in zip files over and over.\nThere is an abundance of Git-jargon; you only need these few words to start:\n\n-   Repository (pronounced *Repo*) : *The folder where we store everything we want to track.*\n\n-   Clone: *Copy another repo so you can plagiarize as your own*\n\n-   Fork: *Collaborate on someone else's repo*\n\n-   Commit: *Create a checkpoint in the repo, locally*\n\n-   Pull: *Update the repo with any changes not already on your version*\n\n-   Push: *Make your checkpoint (commit) visible globally*\n\n### Approach 1: Create project using Git, then download it to your machine\n\nWithin here, there are two approaches.\nOne of them uses GitHub Desktop, a standalone program, and the other uses [github.com](https://github.com) itself, the website.\n\nWe **strongly** suggest using GitHub Desktop, as it will make managing your Git repositories easier after setup.\n\n#### Use GitHub Desktop\n\nGitHub Desktop is a standalone program for working with Git and GitHub.\nIt is very beginner-friendly.\nSee [this](https://amathuba.uct.ac.za/d2l/le/lessons/166536/topics/3707345) for more.\n\nHere is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%20=8Dd7KRpKeaE) describing how to use it.\nIt breaks down the basics, but contains a little more information than you need, so you can stop when you are set up.\n\n#### Use GitHub\n\nYou can also create a new repo directly on GitHub, and then clone it (Git-speak for download it).\nHere are the instructions: [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first).\n\n### Approach 2: Begin with `RStudio` project on your machine, and then connect it to GitHub\n\nSee the video `git.mp4` for this process illustrated.\n\nIn `RStudio`, open your project.\n\nThen, run the following code.\n\n#### Install `usethis`\n\nFirstly, ensure `usethis` is installed:\n\n``` r\nif (!requireNamespace(\"usethis\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  install.packages(\"usethis\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Introduce yourself to Git\n\nThen, if you have not set Git up before, you'll need to run the following.\nNote that by \"not set up Git\", I do not mean whether you've installed Git, but rather whether you've given Git basic authorship information.\nIf you're not sure, you can run the following:\n\n``` r\ngert::git_config_global()\n```\n\nI am not exactly sure what it looks like if you've not set up Git authorship information, but the key thing is that it will not have a row where the first column is `user.name` and the second column is your name, and a row where the first column is `user.email` and the second column is your email address.\n\nIf you can see you've not set `user.name` and `user.email`, then run the following, swopping `NULL` with your name and email address:\n\n``` r\n# set your username and your email address\nusername <- NULL  # replace NULL with e.g. \"Miguel Rodo\" (be sure to include the quotes)\nemail <- NULL # replace NULL with e.g. \"miguel.rodo@uct.ac.za\"\nstopifnot(!is.null(username)) # just checking you set this\nstopifnot(!is.null(email))\ngert::git_config_global_set(\"user.name\",  username)\ngert::git_config_global_set(\"user.email\", email)\n```\n\n#### Initialise Git for the project\n\nFinally, you are ready to initialise `git` for that project:\n\n``` r\nusethis::use_git()\n```\n\nWhen it asks you whether you want to commit the extra files, say yes.\nBe aware that you don't type \"Absolutely\" or \"Definitely\" or whatever corresponds to \"yes\", you just type the number that corresponds to `yes`.\n\nAfter running the above, to get the `Git` pane to appear in the top right corner (alongside `Environment` and `History`), you need to close and re-open `RStudio`.\n\nYou will not need to install `usethis` and set `Git` authorship information for each project, but you will need to initialise `Git` for each project.\n\n#### Connect Git to GitHub\n\nRun the following code:\n\n``` r\nusethis::create_github_token()\n```\n\nName the token, set the expiry date and click on `Create`.\nThen copy the token (it looks like `ghp_akerjlwk4j5qlk45j`).\n\nThen, run the following code:\n\n``` r\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n```\n\nand paste your token.\n\n## Further resources\n\n-   Happy Git with R:\n    -   Set up guidance:\n        -   [Why Git?
